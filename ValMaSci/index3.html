		<p>This 126-meter fully furnished Chem Lab consists of chemical resistant top or chemtop workstations with gas lines and faucets, and can individually seat up to 40 students.</p>
		<p>It has a separate lecture room that has a mounted whiteboard for offline lectures, and an Interactive Smartboards or Whiteboards which are also installed in other specialty learning labs.</p>
		<p>Since the safety and health of students are of paramount importance, the Chem Lab has built-in safety mechanisms installed: a Fume Hood Assembly with exhaust that will enable students to handle hazardous chemicals in a contained environment, a Safety Shower with eye wash station that can be used during accidental chemical spills and a well-stocked Wall Mounted First Aid Kit to immediately treat wounds of students arising from experimental emergencies.</p>

		<p>This is where students will do all their group work.</p>
		<p>Take a look at that whiteboard. That is not your run-of-the-mill whiteboard; that is an interactive Smartboard that functions as an electronic whiteboard and a computer screen. No, you can’t use a marker on it. It comes with a stylus. Each of the six laboratories we saw at the first floor has Smartboards.</p>

		</figure>
		</center>
		<p>The Computer Room holds 40 workstations allotted for students and one central workstation for the professor.</p>
		<p>Installed with licensed Windows 7 Professional Operating System and with the latest Microsoft Office software package, the Intel i3 4 Gig workstations are powerful enough to withstand enormous graphics applications like Corel and Adobe Photoshop. These advanced creative softwares are to be covered in the students’ Computer classes.</p>
		<p>Aside from the latest hardware specifications of the computer sets, all workstations have dedicated LAN ports, making this facility hard-wired for fastest internet connection experience.</p>

		<p>VALMASCI students may do most of their reading on the Internet most of the time now, but nothing beats the pleasure of reading a good old book.</p>
		<p>The VALMASCI library will provide the students a wide range of reading choices – from scientific journals to literary classics. This library, exclusive for VALMASCI students, can definitely inspire young Valenzuelano scientists to see the world from different points of view.</p>

		</figure>
		</center>
		<p>The Mathematics Laboratory is especially designed to be the finest training room in campus for sharpening and harnessing competent and achiever students who usually compete in national and international math quiz bowls, mathletes, math wizards, and math olympiads.</p>

		</figure>
		</center>
		<p>The Physics and Robotics Laboratory is where students can drop apples to the ground and study Newton’s laws of gravity, put up planks and explore the ideas behind motion, force and energy, and discover surface tensions or the reason why it hurts a lot when you land on your back in the pool, and other cool stuff brought to us by Physics experiments.</p>
		<p>The Physics and Robotics Laboratory has specifically designed chemtop workstations provided with electrical outlets while the double sink cabinets that carry the water lines have been separated and put away from the electric sockets to ensure safety of student. We do not want any students to be electrocuted while doing electric and physics-related experiments.</p>
		<p>Like the state-of-the-art Chem and Bio Labs, this lab has carefully installed Safety Shower and Eye wash Station and Wall Mounted First Aid Box as safety mechanisms, and the Interactive Smartboards for a conducive and engaging lectures and discussions.</p>

		</figure>
		</center>
		<p>This is where students can effectively practice their diction, intonation, and speech while teachers can effectively facilitate and guide in the interactive learning of the English language.</p>
		<p>The air-conditioned facility with individual speech stations can accommodate up to 35 students. The central language development equipment consists of a powerful Intel i3 and 4 gig memory CPU installed with specially designed speech lab control software.</p>
		<p>It has state-of-the-art speaker system, complete with sound mixer, sound limiter, and power amplifier in case students and teachers may have difficulty in hearing each other.</p>
