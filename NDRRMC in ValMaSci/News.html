				<p>MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – One week since Taal Volcano started erupting in the province of Batangas, Alert Level 4 remains raised, which means a hazardous eruption could still occur "within hours to days."</p>
				<p>The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said on Sunday, January 19, that "intense" volcanic earthquakes continue – an indication that magma is still rising within the volcano. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far)</p>
				<p>Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor the volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former.</p>
				<p>In its 6 pm update on Sunday, Phivolcs said the Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 701 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12. Of these, 176 were felt with intensities ranging from Intensity I to V.</p>
				<p>Just from 5 am to 4 pm on Sunday, there were 10 volcanic earthquakes plotted, including one felt event with Intensity I.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, also from 5 am to 4 pm on Sunday, the Taal Volcano Network recorded 244 volcanic earthquakes, including 3 low-frequency earthquakes. Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr earlier explained that in low-frequency earthquakes, vibrations are not prolonged.</p>
				<p>"Such intense seismic activity likely signifies continuous magmatic intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity," Phivolcs said.</p>
				<p>Aside from volcanic earthquakes, there continues to be "weak" emission from Taal's main crater.</p>
				<p>"Since 8 am this morning, Taal Volcano's activity has been generally characterized by weak emission of steam-laden plumes 300 to 500 meters high from the main crater that drifted to the general southwest," Phivolcs said.</p>
				<p>Notably, though, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission was measured at an average of 4,353 tons per day at 5 pm on Sunday, from the previous average of 1,442 tons per day that Phivolcs cited in its 8 am bulletin.</p>
				<p>Phivolcs states on its website that SO2 is "a major gas component of magma." According to the United States Geological Survey, SO2 is "released from a volcano when magma is relatively near the surface."</p>
				<p>The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) issued a wind forecast in relation to Taal as well.</p>
				<p>Citing PAGASA's wind forecast, Phivolcs said that if the eruption plume remains below 5 kilometers, ash will be drifted to south and southwest of the main crater. But if a major eruption occurs on Sunday and the eruption column exceeds 5 kilometers, "ash will also be drifted to the eastern and northeastern sectors and may fall on portions of Batangas, Laguna, and Quezon."</p>
				<p>"Residents around the volcano are advised to guard against the effects of heavy and prolonged ashfall. Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid the airspace around Taal Volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from the eruption column pose hazards to aircraft," Phivolcs reiterated.</p>
				<p>If a hazardous eruption occurs, Alert Level 5 – the highest – would be raised. This may or may not happen.</p>
				<p>Phivolcs stressed that there must be "total evacuation" of Taal Volcano Island as well as high-risk areas within a 14-kilometer radius from the main crater and "along the Pansipit River Valley where fissuring has been observed."</p>
				<p>Fissuring means cracks were seen on the ground in parts of Batangas province, particularly in the towns of Lemery, Agoncillo, Talisay, and San Nicolas, which are all high-risk areas.</p>
				<p>Phivolcs earlier explained that ground deformation indicates magma is rising at Taal.</p>
				<p>Asked on Sunday whether there is a possibility of Taal's status being downgraded to Alert Level 3, Phivolcs said it is looking at all scenarios.</p>
				<p>"Lahat ng scenarios kino-consider natin.... Maaari tayong magka-lull and then magkaroon tayo ng malakas na pagputok, or we actually cannot relax yet at puwede pa magkaroon ng eruption, or the eruption has died down," said Maria Antonia Bornas, chief of the Phivolcs Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, in a press briefing on Sunday morning.</p>
				<p>(We're considering all scenarios.... We could have a lull and then have a major eruption, or we actually cannot relax yet and there could still be a hazardous eruption, or the eruption has died down.)</p>
				<p>At least 11 towns in Batangas are under complete lockdown to prevent residents from returning to their homes.</p>
				<p>The Batangas provincial government said there are now more than 160,000 evacuees from the province, distributed in evacuation centers in Batangas, Cavite, and Quezon provinces. (WATCH: Taal evacuees rummage for clothes that fit)</p>
				<p>Classes are suspended in the entire Batangas while Taal Volcano remains under Alert Level 4. (READ: Lipa school aims to provide sense of normalcy, dignity to Taal evacuees)</p>
				<p>So far, the cost of agricultural damage in the region of Calabarzon is pegged at P3.06 billion. Ashfall destroyed various crops.</p>
				<p>Both Batangas and Cavite are under a state of calamity. --Rappler</p>

				<p>MANILA, Philippines – The Taal Volcano in Batangas remained under Alert Level 4 early Monday morning, January 13, as it spewed lava fountains amid the threat of a hazardous eruption.</p>

				<p>The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in a bulletin issued 8 am on Monday that the spewing of lava is called a magmatic eruption.</p>

				<p>"This magmatic eruption is characterized by weak lava fountaining accompanied by thunder and flashes of lightning," Phivolcs said.</p>

				<p>The magmatic eruption was recorded from 2:49 am to 4:28 am on Monday.</p>

				<p>It came after a phreatic or steam-driven eruption "in several points" inside the Taal Volcano's main crater, which had begun at 1 pm on Sunday, January 12. An ash column10 to 15 kilometers high was generated.</p>

				<p>Alert Levels 2, 3, and then 4 were swiftly raised on Sunday, forcing thousands of people living in towns near the volcano to flee their homes.</p>
				
				<p>There have been a total of 144 volcanic earthquakes in the Taal area recorded since 1 pm on Sunday.</p>

				<p>Phivolcs said 44 of these earthquakes were felt with intensities ranging from Intensity I to V in Tagaytay City; and in Alitagtag, Lemery, Santo Tomas, and Talisay in Batangas.</p>

				<p>"Such intense seismic activity probably signifies continuous magma intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity," Phivolcs said.</p>

				<p>Batangas was placed under a state of calamity on Monday. The number of evacuees rose to more than 24,000. (READ: 'Lubog na lahat': Calawit residents return to crushed homes)</p>

				<p>Ashfall has spread not just in Batangas but also to other parts of the Calabarzon region, as well as to Metro Manila and Central Luzon.</p>

				<p id="bruh">IF YOU ARE UNDER A VOLCANO WARNING:</p>
				<ul id="list">
					<li>Listen for emergency information and alerts.</li>
					<li>Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, then do so early.</li>
					<li>Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.</li>
					<li>Protect yourself from falling ash.</li>
					<li>Do not drive in heavy ash fall.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p id="bruh">HOW TO STAY SAFE WHEN A VOLCANO THREATENS:<br>
				Prepare NOW</p>
				<ul id="list">
					<li>Know your area’s risk from volcanic eruption.</li>
					<li>Ask local emergency management for evacuation and shelter plans, and for potential means of protection from ash.</li>
					<li>Learn about community warning systems by signing up for a free service called the Volcano Notification Service (VNS) that sends notifications about volcanic activity.</li>
					<li>Get necessary supplies in advance in case you have to evacuate immediately, or if services are cut off. Keep in mind each person’s specific needs, including medication. Do not forget the needs of pets.</li>
					<li>Consult your doctor if you have existing respiratory difficulties.</li>
					<li>Practice a communication and evacuation plan with everyone in your family.</li>
					<li>Have a shelter-in-place plan if your biggest risk is from ash.</li>
					<li>Keep important documents in a safe place. Create password-protected digital copies.</li>
					<li>Find out what your homeowner’s insurance policy will cover when a volcano erupts.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p id="bruh">Survive DURING</p>
				<ul id="list">
					<li>Listen to alerts. The Volcano Notification Service provides up-to-date information about eruptions.</li>
					<li>Follow evacuation orders from local authorities. Evacuate early.</li>
					<li>Avoid areas downwind, and river valleys downstream, of the volcano. Rubble and ash will be carried by wind and gravity.</li>
					<li>Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are if you have enough supplies. Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.</li>
					<li>If outside, protect yourself from falling ash that can irritate skin and injure breathing passages, eyes, and open wounds. Use a well-fitting, certified face mask such as an N95. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of certified masks and the maker’s instructions on how to use the masks.</li>
					<li>Avoid driving in heavy ash fall.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p id="bruh">Be safe AFTER</p>
				<ul id="list">
					<li>Listen to authorities to find out when it is safe to return after an eruption.</li>
					<li>Send text messages or use social media to reach out to family and friends. Phone systems are often busy after a disaster. Only make emergency calls.</li>
					<li>Avoid driving in heavy ash. Driving will stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles.</li>
					<li>If you have any breathing problems, avoid contact with ash. Stay indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside.</li>
					<li>Do not get on your roof to remove ash unless you have guidance or training. If you have to remove ash, then be very careful as ash makes surfaces slippery. Be careful not to contribute additional weight to an overloaded roof.</li>
